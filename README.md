Hi, Iâ€™m Sergei Antsupov (aka @Sergeyir)

My main interests are high particle physics and programming (mostly C++ and Python), so my projects are mostly within these 2 areas.

See my [GitHub pages website](https://sergeyir.github.io) for more information about me. You can also find a list of my documented repositories there.
