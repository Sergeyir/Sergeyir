Hi, Iâ€™m Sergei Antsupov (aka @Sergeyir)

My main interests are high particle physics, and programming (mostly c++ and python) so my projects are mostly within these 2 areas

See my [GitHub pages website](https://sergeyir.github.io/index.html) for more information about me. You can also find a list of my documented repositores there.
